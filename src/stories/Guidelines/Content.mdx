# Content Guidelines

Voice, tone, and writing standards for consistent, human-centered copy.

---

## 1. Sentence case

Use sentence case for headings, labels, and buttons.

- **Correct:** "Save changes"
- **Incorrect:** "Save Changes"

---

## Voice & tone

The Atelier voice is clear, confident, and helpful — never robotic or condescending.

**We are:**

- Clear and concise
- Helpful, not hand-holding
- Professional but warm
- Confident without arrogance

**We avoid:**

- Jargon without context
- Passive voice
- Exclamation marks overuse
- Vague instructions

---

## Writing examples

**Do:**

- "Save changes" — clear action
- "3 items selected" — precise feedback
- "Enter your email to continue" — helpful instruction
- "Something went wrong. Try again." — honest error

**Don't:**

- "Click here!!!" — vague and aggressive
- "Oopsie! An error occurred!" — too casual for errors
- "Please be advised that the operation has concluded" — verbose
- "Error 0x4F2B" — meaningless to users

---

## Button labels

Action-oriented, starting with a verb.

| Label | Use Case |
| --- | --- |
| `Save` | For persisting changes |
| `Create` | For new items (Create project) |
| `Delete` | For destructive actions (pair with confirmation) |
| `Cancel` | For dismissing without action |
| `Continue` | For multi-step flows |
| `Send` | For messages, invites, emails |

---

## Error messages

Be specific about what went wrong and how to fix it.

Reference our **[semantic colors](?path=/docs/foundations-colors--docs)** when choosing error tone and color.

| Bad | Good |
| --- | --- |
| ~~Invalid input~~ | Email must include @ and a domain (e.g., name@example.com) |
| ~~Error occurred~~ | We couldn't save your changes. Check your connection and try again. |
| ~~Forbidden~~ | You don't have permission to edit this project. Contact the owner. |

---

## Placeholder text

Provide realistic examples, not generic filler.

| Bad | Good |
| --- | --- |
| ~~Enter text here~~ | e.g., alice@example.com |
| ~~Type something~~ | Search by name or email... |
| ~~Input~~ | San Francisco, CA |
