# Design Principles

The philosophy and values that guide every decision in the Atelier design system.

---

## Core Principles

### 1. Clarity Over Cleverness
Every element should communicate its purpose immediately. Avoid ambiguity in labels, icons, and interactions. When in doubt, be explicit.

### 2. Consistency Breeds Confidence
Reuse patterns, tokens, and components. Users build mental models — consistency reinforces them. Every deviation should be intentional and justified.

### 3. Accessible by Default
Accessibility is not a feature — it's a requirement. Every component must meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards. Keyboard navigation, screen reader support, and sufficient contrast are non-negotiable.

### 4. Progressive Disclosure
Show only what's needed at each step. Use layered information architecture — summaries first, details on demand. Reduce cognitive load.

### 5. Density with Purpose
Information-dense interfaces are fine when they serve expert users. Balance data visibility with breathing room. Let spacing and hierarchy guide the eye.

### 6. Motion with Meaning
Animation should communicate state changes, not decorate. Every transition should answer: what changed, where did it go, what should I look at next?

### 7. Ship, Then Refine
A working component shipped today beats a perfect component shipped never. Start with sensible defaults, iterate based on real usage data.

## Decision Framework

When evaluating component or pattern decisions, ask:

| # | Question |
|---|----------|
| Q1 | Does it solve a real, recurring problem? |
| Q2 | Is it consistent with existing patterns? |
| Q3 | Can a new team member understand it in under 30 seconds? |
| Q4 | Does it degrade gracefully (accessibility, responsive, error states)? |
| Q5 | Will it still make sense in 6 months? |
