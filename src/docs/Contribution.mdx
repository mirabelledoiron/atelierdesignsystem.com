How to propose, build, and document new components for the Atelier design system.

---

## Component Proposal Process

### 1. Identify the Need
Document the use case. Is this solving a recurring problem? Is there an existing component that could be extended instead?

### 2. Research Patterns
Look at how other design systems handle it. Check Radix, shadcn/ui, and Material for prior art.

### 3. Draft the API
Define props, variants, and sizes. Keep the API surface minimal — you can always add, but removing is a breaking change.

### 4. Build & Document
Create the component with all variants, states, and accessibility support. Add a Storybook page with install, import, usage, and API reference.

### 5. Review & Merge
Get design and engineering review. Ensure WCAG compliance, responsive behavior, and dark mode support.
